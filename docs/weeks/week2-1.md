# Week 2 Mentorship program

# Date: 27/10/2025

## Discussion points

- It is important to take note of how DHCP assigns IP addresses go back and watch the video of the labs being set up to properly grasp the concept
- The yaml file when setting up mkdocs, take note of how yaml files work because they are needed for a lot of things
- It's paramount for me to learn Git because it is very important to work with teams and for backtracking, very needed in the field of Cybersecurity.
- We also discussed about the roadmap I'll be taking, leaning into Offensive and getting to introduce myself to Defensive security to see how the other side works.

## Actionable points

- Make sure that all files modified for the weekly checkins are duly updated, and ensure they are pushed
- Look into/do a little research on webgoat so I could get to play around with it and understand how it works.
- Watch videos on how to ingest logs into the wazuh server set up
- Ensure the completion of other outstanding tasks
