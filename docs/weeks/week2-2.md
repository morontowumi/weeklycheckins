## Week 2 Mentorship Program

## Date: 1/11/2025

## Discussion points

- Challenges I had over the week installing the wazuh server.
- LinkedIn and how I can boost my online presence so my profile can reach more people and I can draw more people to my blog on medium i.e don't post using technical language people don't understand.
- Various SIEM tools, how to use them and what to use them for. It helps in the future for evasion analysis e.g., understanding how an attacker could enter the system without being detected by the SIEM.

## Actionable points

- Send Windows event logs to the Wazuh server.
- Aggregate incoming logs and develop parsing rules.
- Ensure logs are formatted consistently for parsing and analysis.
End goal: if I attack the Windows machine, I should be able to see it in the logs.

### Next meeting: Monday, 3rd of November 2025
